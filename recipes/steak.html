          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1x thickish cut steak</strong> - no more than 2.5cm/1" thick.</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 knob of butter</li>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh rosemary</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Recipe</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Bring steak to room temperature by removing from fridge at least 30 minutes prior to cooking.</li>
            <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper to help form a great crust when searing the steak.</li>
            <li>Heat a frying pan to a high temperature.</li>
            <li>Add knob of butter and garlic cloves to pan, allowing the butter to coat the entirety of the surface of the pan, then add the steak.</li>
            <li>Flip steak every minute until cooked. I find to reach medium it takes around 3 minutes 30 seconds.</li>
          </ol>
